A vulnerability analysis is a review that focuses on security-relevant issues that either moderately or severely impact the security of the product or system.
The security scanning process consists of four steps: testing, analysis, assessment and remediation.

Vulnerability assessment tools are designed to automatically scan for new and existing threats that can target your application. Types of tools include:
Web application scanners that test for and simulate known attack patterns.

Protocol scanners that search for vulnerable protocols, ports and network services.

Network scanners that help visualize networks and discover warning signals like stray IP addresses, spoofed packets and suspicious packet generation from a single IP address.
